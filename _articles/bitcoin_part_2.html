We talked last time about the background for modern currency, how we got to where we are today, and most curiously, how it's not actually as big a deal as you might think that there is <span style="background-color: #ccddfd;" title="The American consumer: ultimate Irrational Confidence Guy">little more than psychology and convenience</span> backing up the dollar.
<h1>Bitcoin</h1>
Enter Bitcoin.  Bitcoin is the first viable implementation of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency">cryptocurrency</a>, meaning it relies on modern cryptographic techniques for currency generation, distribution, and transaction verification.  The technical specifications for Bitcoin were published in a <a href="http://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">psuedonymous 2008 paper</a> under the name "<span style="background-color: #ccddfd;" title="Nobody knows who Satoshi Nakamoto is, or whether it was a group or a single person.">Satoshi Nakamoto.</span>" Bitcoin represents a significant departure from traditional currency.
<h2>How it Works</h2>
Just like how banks have ledgers that tell them how much money each depositor is owed, Bitcoin has a ledger. The difference is that Bitcoin's ledger is open, public, and available to everyone. People aren't identified by names, but rather by cryptographic public keys. You can create a new Bitcoin identity whenever you want- and in fact Bitcoin itself recommends <a href="http://bitcoin.org/en/you-need-to-know">creating a new identity for each transaction</a>.  Bitcoin nodes keep track of which users have how many Bitcoins, and only allow transactions from a user who has the requisite number of Bitcoins.

Any time a user wants to make a payment, he declares to the network that he is transfering <span style="background-color: #ccddfd;" title="Each Bitcoin has a set value, but transactions take multiple bitcoins as input and output two resulting Bitcoins- one for payment, and one for change.  Thus, each Bitcoin is destroyed as soon as it is an input to a transaction, and two new Bitcoins are created for each transaction">some number of Bitcoins</span> from his <span style="background-color: #ccddfd;" title="Public Key">unique ID</span> to a second unique ID.  He verifies that it is in fact him making the declaration by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography">signing </a>the previous transaction and the public key of the recipient <span style="background-color: #ccddfd;" title="Thus, anyone with access to the public key can verify that the owner of the private key is the one who made the declaration">with his own private key</span>. Your private key is like a safe-deposit box key.  If you lose access to it, you lose access to any coins tied to your public key in the official public ledger.  If someone steals it, they will be able to spend your coins without your consent.

Once a transaction is broadcast, various nodes around the network <span style="background-color: #ccddfd;" title="Transactions are announced on a best-effort basis, so not everyone is guaranteed to receive all the transactions">pick up the message</span> and include the transaction into their current "block".  A block is defined as a set of transactions that have been announced since the last block was added to the blockchain.  The blockchain is defined as the set of all blocks that have been verified by Bitcoin miners since the inception of Bitcoin.  In practice, the blockchain is a large file, <a href="http://blockchain.info/charts/blocks-size">currently about 10 GB</a>, that is shared by everyone, and contains every valid transaction since Bitcoin started.  It <em>is</em> the public ledger.

The Bitcoin "miners" are actively hashing their current block of announced transactions with a <span style="background-color: #ccddfd;" title="A randomly generated value">nonce</span>, looking for some combination that creates a hash with a predetermined number of leading zeros.  For a block to be successfully hashed, a Bitcoin miner must discover a block/nonce combination that hashes to a value that fits within the difficulty parameter.  For example, if the difficulty parameter is currently set at <span style="background-color: #ccddfd;" title="Or more accurately, 12 zero bits">3 zero's</span>, then a block/nonce combo that hashes to 0x000a635... will be considered a valid block/nonce combo.  A block/nonce combo that hashes to 0x001a635... will be considered an <span style="background-color: #ccddfd;" title="This system relies on the cryptographic strenght of a hash, that a small perturbation in the input leads to a random perturbation in the output.  You can't change the nonce by a little and hope the hash will change only a little; you must instead brute force the problem, trying as many combinations as possible until you get lucky.  This conclusion has been challenged in a recent paper out of MIT.  *gulp*">invalid block/nonce combo</span>.

Once a node finds a valid block/nonce combo, they broadcast their work to all the other nodes.  Since verifying the work is easy, everyone can quickly decide whether or not the block/nonce combo is valid.  Once validity is determined, a block is accepted into the blockchain IFF all transaction are valid and have not already been spent.  A node signifies its acceptance of the block by including it in its own blockchain, and working on its next block <span style="background-color: #ccddfd;" title="This is crucially important.  It means that as long as at least 50% of the total compute power is playing nicely, only valid blocks without double spending get accepted into the block chain, because the good guys will always eventually outpace the bad guys, and newcomers trust longer blockchains.

<h2>Bitcoin Production Economics</h2>
Bitcoin miners get paid in two ways: newly minted coins and transaction fees.

By convention, the first transaction of any block in the blockchain is a special transaction that creates a previously nonexistent Bitcoin with a constant value.  That constant value is set to divide in half every <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mining#Reward">210,000 blocks</a>, or approximately every 4 years.  The current value is <span style="background-color: #ccddfd;" title="Roughly $3,000 at the time of this writing.">25 Bitcoins</span>.  This provides a way to introduce currency into the market, and to reward miners for doing the computationally intensive work of hashing (and thus keeping the currency secure for everyone else!).  Note that increasing the money supply is a traditionally inflationary pressure.

Transaction fees are optional fees that Bitcoin users may choose to pay to incentivize miners to include their transactions in the blockchain.  As mining rewards dwindle, transaction fees are going to become a significantly larger portion of the total profit of miners. The minted Bitcoin award is set to expire somewhere around <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/FAQ#How_does_the_halving_work_when_the_number_gets_really_small.3F">the year 2140</a>, when the Bitcoin reward gets rounded down to 0.  At this point, the entirety of monetary incentive for the miner nodes will be transaction fees.

There does not seem to be any incentive for a miner to include transactions that aren't offering transaction fees.  In fact, some exchanges require transaction fees that scale with the amount of data (transaction size) that you're requesting be processed, with certain low-data, low-value transactions being processed out of the <span style="background-color: #ccddfd;" title="Or rather, because miners like liquidity in the market just as much as buyers do.">goodness of the miners hearts</span>. Transaction fees will ultimately be de facto enforced, as no <span style="background-color: #ccddfd;" title="Economically rational">sane</span> miner would process transactions for which they were not being paid.

The astute observer may notice a problem: if the value of a Bitcoin ever falls below the energy cost to produce the next block in the blockchain, correct thing for miners to do would be to shut down operations.  If everyone did this, Bitcoin would become unusable, which would crash the value to 0.  Bitcoin has an intruiging built-in solution to this: hash difficulty changes based on a how long it took to hash the last block.  We said earlier that hashes must fall below some threshold for leading zero's in order to be declared valid- well that threshold changes based on how fast the last several blocks have been hashed.  Thus, if hash competition drops, then hashing becomes easier.  Conversely, the more people are mining, the more difficult mining is going to become. This has a nice stabalization effect- the market can support some number of Bitcoin miners, but any more than that and <em>everyone</em> starts to lose. If too few people are mining, then the next guy who decides to start is going to make some easy money, because hashes are easy to produce.
<h2>Why we Want Bitcoin</h2>
Bitcoin has some significant advantages over traditional currencies- namely, that online transactions don't go through a third party financial institution.  Third party financial institutions have traditionally been forced to take on the role of mediator in transactional disputes, meaning that non-reversible transactions aren't really possible.  Bitcoin doesn't suffer from this weakness; once a transaction is committed to the blockchain, it is permanent.  Since third party financial institutions incur a cost of mediation that they must pass on to users, direct non-reversible transactions both save money and reduce the trust requirement between merchant and customer.
<h2>Bitcoin is unbacked</h2>
You might be tempted, as I was, to think that the value of bitcoins is in their scarcity; in particular, the computational difficulty of generating the next bitcoin. But it turns out that at current exchange rates, the value of bitcoins <span style="background-color: #ccddfd;" title="Roughly a 4.5x multiplier">vastly exceeds</span> the <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-12/virtual-bitcoin-mining-is-a-real-world-environmental-disaster.html">energy costs of production</a>.

The actual value of Bitcoins is much the same as the value of the dollar- it's worth whatever people are willing to pay for it.  Bitcoin is <em>useful</em>, because it provides advantages over traditional currency that brings value to the online transaction ecosystem.

At the moment, Bitcoin is going through some growing pains.  It is viewed by many as a speculative vehicle, and is suffering some extreme bubble/bust behavior because of it.  There is no central bank backing up the currency, so there's nobody to try to stop the bubble.  It's a big game of chicken to see who can exit their bitcoin position at maximum value, but before the big crash.  This should make you uncomfortable if you're at all familliar with the 2008 financial crash, the 2000 dot com bubble, or the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip_mania">1637 Dutch tulip bubble</a>.  Unchecked speculative bubbles do not generally end well for those involved.
<h2>Bitcoin is anti-inflation</h2>
Bitcoin <em>wants </em>to be <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Myths#Bitcoin_can.27t_work_because_there_is_no_way_to_control_inflation">non-inflationary</a>.  They are claiming it as a feature.  The claim is that, as Bitcoin stabalizes, an equilibrium will be reached in the exchange rate between Bitcoins and real goods.  If this is indeed the case (and there is significant contention over whether or not this is true), then currency is not the right word to use.  For all intents and purposes, Bitcoin is trying to be a commodity.  It is trying to set itself up as a digital good whos price doesn't consistently move relative to the prices of other goods.  As dollars underwent inflation, the dollar value of a Bitcoin would go up- but the purchasing power would remain relatively constant.

But what the heck is a digital commodidy worth?  The value of Bitcoin is in its future transactional convenience- the only reason someone would ever want a Bitcoin is if they intend to use it later to buy some other good.  This is true of currency too, of course, but it's also traditionally true of other value stores like <span style="background-color: #ccddfd;" title="These days gold and silver have industrial applications, but from a theory perspective, pure value stores are a historical fact.">gold and silver</span>.  Precious metals function as value stores, despite having no inherent use on their own.  Their value come from their rarity, and the presumed willingness of other people to trade useful goods for that value store.  These attributes are no more inherent to gold than to Bitcoin.

On the other hand, you could always turn gold into jewelry, as an external sign of wealth or simply as socially conditioned preening behavior.  What do you do with unspent bits?
<h2>Objections to Bitcoin</h2>
First, we should dispense with the notion that Bitcoin is unique in converting real-world energy into inherently valueless outputs.  Bitcoin mining certainly has significant energy costs associated with it- but so does mining for gold.  And Bitcoins are undeniably more useful as a currency than gold is today.  There is some value in having a physical thing to point to as the output of a system, but less than you might imagine.  After all, we generally dig up gold from mountains just to turn around and put it into underground vaults.  A bigger objection might be that the Bitcoin network is going to require us to continue putting in this energy indefinitely to keep the blockchain secure.  This is true.  But maintaining a fiat currency- even a digital one- isn't cheap either.  Banks take on the cost of arbitration, governments take on the significant cost of printing <span style="background-color: #ccddfd;" title="Paper money needs to be replaced every 18 months or so">paper money</span> and coins, and online payment systems take on the cost of running servers to verify transactions.  Rather than paying these costs to big banks and governments, Bitcoin pays its operating costs to energy companies and entreprenuers.  It may end up being the case that Bitcoin costs significantly more to maintain than alternative currencies, but that is certainly not clear from the available data.

There do, however, seem to be some significant open questions for Bitcoin.  Proponents of Bitcoin would like to assure you that <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Myths">they're not really issues</a> of course- and in some cases, I agree.  But I'm not sold on all of them.  In particular, Bitcoin is fundamentally <strong>not</strong> really a decentralized currency- the Bitcoin.org foundation, and the developers working on the Bitcoin standard, control the very definition of what it means for something to be a Bitcoin.  What happens if the organization gets new management that tries to integrate some central banking principals into the system?  What happens if they simply make a mistake?  <em>Someone</em> is ultimately controlling Bitcoin, even if it is open source.  We can't just hand-wave away the risk that people at the top might do stupid things- not just today, but into the future indefinitely.

Historically, non-inflationary currencies don't work all that well- at least not in complex interconnected economies.  Artificially limited supply combined with <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Fractional_Reserve_Banking_and_Bitcoin">Fractional Reserve Banking</a> is <em>exactly</em> what led to the US moving off the gold standard.  Certainly there are significant differences between gold-backed dollars and Bitcoins, but if you assume no inflation- as Bitcoin seems to claim- then you hit the same problem: a run on the currency with the inability to devalue the currency leads to insolvency.  Bitcoin would of course end up <span style="background-color: #ccddfd;" title="The 'no inflation' claim seems specific to times of economic stability">undergoing extreme inflation</span>, since nobody has precommitted to paying for Bitcoins at a certain rate.  But the lack of central authority means nobody is trying to curb that inflation- and the reason inflation curbing policies are a thing is because they work.  Bitcoin is a fundamentally worse place to put your money during economic upheaval than government backed currency, specifically because it has none of the advantages and all of the disadvantages of a regular currency <em>in that particular economic environment</em>.

Security is likewise a significant problem space for Bitcoin- though it doesn't appear to be a much bigger problem for Bitcoin than it is for traditional online banking.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computer#Potential">Breaking cryptography</a> hurts our current financial system just as much as it hurts Bitcoin.  That said, it must be acknowledged that Bitcoin, and the popular Bitcoin exchanges, have had some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#Theft">significant security breaches</a> in their relatively short history.

Meaningful consumer protection is a rather foreign concept in a decentralized, unregulated economy.  As much as Bitcoin wants to pitch its lack of central interference as a feature, we have government backed currency in part because limitted regulation is a good thing.  It increases consumer confidence, lowers risk, and prevents catastrophic failure.  With no guarantees of this sort, it's difficult to imagine Bitcoin fairing well during economically unstable times.
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
My own conclusion is that Bitcoin is unlikely to gracefully survive the next severe economic downturn.  The same issues that spelled the end of the gold standard will take their toll on Bitcoin as well.  It will likely remain a stable and useable currency during times of economic prosperity, but when consumer confidence in the economy starts to erode, there will be no action anyone can take to shore up Bitcoin.  Bitcoin simply doesn't have the historical or visceral cache of gold to act like a true commodity, and without the backing of a central bank willing to print money, set interest rates, control inflation, and intervene to save consumers from unscrupulous banking practices, we're eventually going to see a massive devaluation of the currency.

Centralized fiat currencies have all of these mitigations because they're <em>useful</em>.  Whether or not Bitcoin recovers from the predicted catastrophe to regain it's status as a usable currency, I don't know; but I do know that I am unlikely to ever store a substantial amount of money in Bitcoins.  And if I think it's too risky to be worth it, I see no reason to conclude that others won't feel the same way.

I hope I'm wrong, because Bitcoin is useful.  If it maintains it's value, and proves to be a reliable value store in hard times the same way gold has, the world will be better for it.  I just don't see it happening when the stakes are an all-out economic recession, and the public sees no assuring authority figure promising them everything is going to be OK.
