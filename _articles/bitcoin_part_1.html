<span style="color: #008000;">/* What has value is already so, owning up to it doesn't make it worse */</span>
<h1>Currency</h1>
Modern currency has value <span style="background-color: #ccddfd;" title="If and only if">IFF</span> everyone agrees that it has value.

How on earth did we get here? Back in the good old bartering days, you actually needed two physical chickens and a goat if you wanted to trade me for my cow. But this method scales really, really poorly. If you wanted to get anything done at scale, you needed a stand-in for the actual physical goods you were exchanging. The first currencies <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency#Early_currency">arose in Egypt</a> as receipts for some amount of grain stored in warehouses. You didn't actually have to give someone several tons of grain- you could just give them a <span style="background-color: #ccddfd;" title="Let's call it a grain-dollar">receipt</span> that <em>entitled</em> them to a specific amount of grain. They could go get that grain from the warehouse at their earliest convenience, or- crucially- turn around and trade their grain-dollar to someone else for something they actually wanted. Notice that we've just established our first <span style="background-color: #ccddfd;" title="For this system to work, both the buyer and the seller have to have a lot of confidence in the grain warehouse.">bank</span>- whoever is keeping the records in that grain warehouse is on the hook for any <span style="background-color: #ccddfd;" title="In practice, early currencies were quite varied.  They used various value stores, from grain receipts to ivory to gold to beads.  Anything that was widely considered to have intrinsic value, but was still able to move around and change hands easily, functioned as a currency">deposit slips</span> they issue.

What we're talking about is called a backed currency. Grain-dollars are backed in grain, and you can in principle go trade your grain-dollars for actual grain, even if nobody ever actually does it in practice. In the US, we used to have a <span style="background-color: #ccddfd;" title="Technically, a bi-metallic standard with gold and silver, then to unbacked fiat currency during the Civil War, then back to a gold standard. Surprisingly complicated history.">gold-backed</span> currency. You could, in principle, exchange your dollars for some amount of gold, no questions asked. As of 1976, the US has officially switched off the gold standard. So what's backing it now, you ask? Absolutely nothing. Seriously. But we'll get to that later.
<h2>Why we don't actually use Grain-Dollars</h2>
The fundamental function of currency is to symbolically represent the value of goods and services. In doing so, a successful currency delineates an exchange rate between different types of goods and services.  But imagine if you had to have cow-dollars to represent how many cows you owned, and grain-dollars to represent your bushels of grain, and a goat-dollar for each of your goats? You would have to establish exchange rates between <span style="background-color: #ccddfd;" title="O(n^2), for you algorithm wonks"><em>every single currency</em></span>. Moreover, it's just not all that <em>useful</em>. An inefficient market, where the exchange rates between 3 different currencies didn't exactly match, would present arbitrage opportunities, and even an efficient market would suffer serious liquidity problems trying to exchanging one type of money for another.  If you had an esoteric resource, like Nuclear-Fuel-Dollars, who are you going to find to take them?

In fact, we see a variation of this problem in the world economy even today- different countries have different currencies.  The countries that print their own money are (usually) stable enough and few enough that we don't run into the same kinds of problems we do with grain-dollars and cow-dollars, but multiple currencies still introduces practical inefficiencies, and we still see significant inter-currency trading. Countries are willing to accept those inefficiencies for a few reasons, but mostly it's because the ability to mess with your own currency- raising interest rates, setting currencies exchange rates, etc.- is valuable. China in particular is a notorious "currency manipulator."

The too-many-currencies problem is what historically led to Coinage. It's better for all parties involved to have a single currency which can be exchanged for any good than to have multiple currencies that must be exchanged between each other. In a coinage system, you've incurred some small cost of printing money, and you may incur a small inefficiency by converting your goats into dollars into cows, instead of directly from goats into cows. But you get the benefit of being able to use your currency anytime, anywhere, to buy anything. The important thing is that money is fungible- you can in principle trade anything with value for money, and trade money for anything with value.

Initially, governments weren't explicitly backing coins with any physical resource; the coins <em>were</em> the resource.  You would actually make a coin out of solid gold or silver, and it's value was equal to the <span style="background-color: #ccddfd;" title="This system tends only to work if the relative rarity of different metals stays the same, and therefore their relative value remains consistent.  Otherwise, you essentially have multiple currencies, one for each underlying resource type">equivalent weight in the underlying asset</span>.  The stamping of coins was simply a <span style="background-color: #ccddfd;" title="Such systems are, of course, vulerable to counterfeiting and coin-shaving">guarantee</span> to the merchant that the coin had been measured by the proper authorities to be of a certain size and weight.

Of course, coins are hardly optimal for all transactions.  You wouldn't want to make any large purchases (say, a ship, or an estate) with coins.  Thus paper money is introduced as a stand in.  Just like we had grain-dollars, we now have coin-dollars; you can exchange this paper money for the equivalent coin value.  Just like in grain-dollars, the currency-issuing authority is playing a direct role in propping up the currency.  Paper money is only as good as the paper money issuer is <span style="background-color: #ccddfd;" title="sort of like how checks are only as trustworthy as the bank that's issuing them">trustworthy</span>.

So we've established that "dollars" is better than "goat-dollars + cow-dollars + grain-dollars...", and that we might want to use a stand in for the actual physical underlying resource.  But what's to stop someone from refusing to take dollars in the first place? Specifically, we should be worried about someone giving us currency- ultimately useless paper or coins- in exchange for goods, then doing their best <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX7wtNOkuHo">Nelson "Ha Ha!</a>" and saying that they're not accepting currency anymore. Is it possible for an individual to take advantage of the system?
<h2>Cheating the system</h2>
As it turns out, no, because that individual had to put something in to get their money in the first place. They either coined it themselves, or stole it, or they traded real, tangible, valuable things for it. If they obtained their money legally, then by spending their money on goods and refusing to accept money in the future, all they've actually done is removed themselves from the market. Everyone else can continue to use money, and the nefarious Nelson only gets out the value he originally put in- whatever was traded to obtain that money in the first place. If Nelson obtained the money illegally- stealing it or printing his own- then he's really just a thief, and thieves can steal livestock (almost) as easily as they can steal money. Not using currency won't protect you there.

This demonstrates why having a central printer is crucial in any currency system. If you didn't have a government or institution issuing secure currency, then a bad actor could print money for basically 0 cost (forging grain receipts, for example), give it to you in exchange for goods, and he's just- in a roundabout way- stolen your goods without you noticing. So whatever currency we decide to implement, it must be extremely difficult to spoof- ideally, at least as difficult to spoof as the actual underlying asset.

But there's also a more fundamental reason that Nelson is unlikely to completely remove himself from the currency market: currency is <em>useful</em>. If he stops taking currency, then he has no currency with which to buy things.  He must be either self-sufficient, or convince everyone around him to barter instead of using currency. Once currency use reaches a critical mass, neither of these things is trivial- particularly in a developed economy like we have today.

We've also noticed an important property of centralized currencies- it's impossible for a small actor to devalue them. In order for bad things like defaltion or hyper-inflation to happen, you need a large segment of the market to go haywire. This is particularly true as use of a currency scales out- if you can just go to the next town over to buy gas, then your town's gas station refusing to take dollars is a much bigger deal for them than it is for you. They are going to lose all their business to Shelbyville, whereas you just have to drive an extra few minutes. As long as there is competition that is willing to accept the currency, and enough people want to use the currency, you end up in an equilibrium where everyone is <span style="background-color: #ccddfd;" title="This is the same reason credit cards work. It is not to the advantage of any single merchant to accept credit cards, but because all their competitors do, they're stuck in a Nash Equilibrium where they have to. If you're wondering why any of them started in the first place, the answer is that it was a long, hard battle for credit card companies.">forced to accept the currency</span>.

So, we've established that money works as a stand in for value, that you need some reliable, non-spoofable way of printing it.  The interesting question is what's driving the value of modern currencies?  Does whether or not a currency has value depend solely on whether or not people are willing to accept it in lieu of goods?  What exactly is backing the dollar?
<h2>So what's backing the Dollar?</h2>
Nothing. But this is actually less of a problem than you might think.

The nice thing about a gold standard is that it ties the value of your currency to a real value in the real world. If it costs 2 dollars for a pound of strawberries, and each dollar can be exchanged for 1 oz of gold, then you know the exchange rate between gold and strawberries.  If that number ever goes out of whack, someone smart will come a long and do a triangle trade between gold, strawberries, and dollars, until the price of the three <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrage">reaches equilibrium</a>.

When you go off a physical standard, it means the value of the dollar is now an independent variable. You can still buy gold with your dollars, just not a predetermined-government-guaranteed-set-amount of gold. In this case, the dollar is basically a Jedi mind trick the government has pulled on us- it's value is purely psychological. It has value today because it had value yesterday, and we expect other people to still want it tomorrow.  On the other hand, we kind of <em>always</em> had this problem.  Who says gold is worth anything?  Well... people do.  Why?  Just kind of, because.  Because it's rare.  And shiny. That's about it.  And if <em>that's</em> a valid basis for currency, why shouldn't pattern recognition be just as valid?

But there's something else important to notice about unbacked currencies, even when they're working properly.  If everyone accepts that the dollar is a unit of measure, then they know what they payed in dollars for a cheeseburger last week. If they see you try to charge more than that, they're going to be reluctant to pay. They go and look for a competitor who's going to charge less- and if your competitor is able to charge less and still turn a profit (his costs are less than the money he makes selling cheeseburgers), he's going to do it. In practice, this means that the price of everything slowly creeps up. First someone raises the price of hamburgers a few cents. Then the factories have to raise pay by a few cents so their workers can afford to eat. Then the factories have to raise prices so they can afford to pay their workers more. This raises the ingredient costs for the hamburger producer, which means they have to raise prices again. Rinse and repeat.

This process is called inflation, and it's the gradual devaluing of money over time. Inflation doesn't happen in a backed currency.

Note that the above is a paraphrasing of <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/costpushinflation.asp">Cost-Push Inflation theory</a> along with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_theory_of_value">Subjective Theory of Value</a>, both of which seem to me the most reasonable approximations for how economies actually work.  However, as far as I know there is no consensus among economists, and there exist other competing theories of value and inflation.
<h2>So why'd we go off the gold standard in the first place?</h2>
As it turns out, inflation is <span style="background-color: #ccddfd;" title="To be clear: some inflation is good (roughly 3% per year).  Too much inflation is really, really bad"><em>good</em></span>- or at least, today we think so.  Not all classical economists would agree. Not even all current economists would agree. But most of them do.

Inflation incentivizes people to keep investing. If you just just <span style="background-color: #ccddfd;" title="Leave it under your mattress, for example">sit on your money</span> while inflation is happening, then your money is actively losing value. In order to maintain or grow your value, you're forced to invest in various financial instruments- short term government bonds if you just want to counteract inflation, or long term bonds, equities, or new ventures if you want actual growth.  Some economists argue that inflation can be viewed as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_tax">hidden tax on assets</a>.  But since people investing in their economy turns out to be good for everyone in the long run, and inflation helps keep that going, lots of economists are ok with it.

Additionally, decoupling currency from a physical standard gives the government a few additional powers. The government now has two levers with which to control the economy- printing money (which devalues the currency), and setting interest rates (which do a myriad things, from driving economic growth to establishing a rough bound on inflation).

But none of that is the reason we left the gold standard.  Ultimately, we left the gold standard because we <em>had</em> to.

The monetary history of the dollar is actually quite fascinating, but the short version is confusing enough. One of the disadvantages of paper money is that since the paper has no intrinsic value, there's nothing stopping an issuer from printing more money than they have gold to back it.  The US was doing precisely this in the early twentieth century, as were all the other developed nations.  But the US had laws on the books that said they had to keep enough gold on hand to redeem 40% of the currency in circulation.  When people <span style="background-color: #ccddfd;" title="Partly because of the currency failures of European countries, and partly because of the Great Depression">started to lose confidence</span> in the dollar, and began redeeming dollars for gold, there was a widespread run on US currency- our money supply began <span style="background-color: #ccddfd;" title="Since people took their gold and went home, we couldn't print more money, since we were required to back it with at least 40% gold">contracting</span>, and we saw the dreaded deflation rear it's ugly head.  Deflation rewarded people who held onto their money instead of investing it, and caused a cascading slowdown in the economy.  In short, we were stuck in the Great Depression, and we needed to print more money to get out of it.  But even then, we didn't abandon the gold standard.  Instead, we instituted an across-the-board 40% devaluation of the dollar.  Specifically, we changed the price of one ounce of gold from $20.67 to $35.  This allowed us to print a whole bunch more money without <span style="background-color: #ccddfd;" title="Our failure to do so is blamed by some economists for extending the Great Depression.">floating the dollar</span>, since our current gold reserves were worth a lot more dollars than they used to be. So we survived the Great Depression with our gold standard intact- but just barely.

After World War II, a whole bunch of currencies got pegged to the dollar.  Initially we tried honoring the gold standard, but there was too much money in circulation for us to allow international redemption of currency for gold.  We simply didn't have enough gold to allow people to trade Francs for Dollars, then immediately exchange those Dollars for gold.  It became clear that we couldn't maintain a partially backed gold standard, even after further devaluing the dollar, so we had no choice but to float our currency.

Up until the move away from the gold standard, paper money had seen a somewhat troubling bubble-bust cycle.  Printing more money than we had gold to back it increased inflationary pressures, which over-valued the currency, at which point people started demanding their gold back.  This caused a currency crash and reduced paper money demand to essentially 0. By getting off the gold standard, we did away with the ability to claim gold for your dollars, so we prevented the bust portion of the cycle.  But we didn't stop the bubble part.  Now there's nothing to reign in runaway inflation, except for monetary policy manipulation- setting interest rates to an artificially high level- and consumer confidence- the proverbial Jedi mind trick. Those are the only remaining checks on hyper-inflation.

No country in the world today has an enforceable gold or silver backed currency.

Notice that the move away from a physical standard is an extremely recent development.  We like to think we've got this figured out- and smarter people than I are running economies throughout the world.  But we are still very much in the experimental stage of unbacked fiat currency.  Whether or not this is historically sustainable (i.e. sustainable through inevitable depressions, wars, etc.) is an open question.  People can still horde gold like they used to, and if we see another run on the dollar without the backing of gold, it's unclear how we're going to deal with it (re-instituting a temporary partial gold standard might be on the table /speculation)

Similarly, we're not really sure how long term deficit-spending is going to work out.  It's really only possible because of inflation, and it seems like we've dug ourselves a hole that's not easy to get out of. Whether or not this comes back to bite us in the ass <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deficit_spending">is an open question</a> (my gut feeling is that it will. I have no basis for said feeling.)
<h1>Digital Banking</h1>
So now that we've abstracted value into floating currency, it's a really short leap to digital banking.  Just like we had grain-dollars and coin-dollars, we now have... uh.... dollar-dollars.... ok, I admit that needs some work.  What we have is a set of institutions (banks) who hold our physical dollars for us.  They know how much money you have because they keep track every time you deposit and withdraw money.  They don't issue you physical receipts for your money like they used to do with grain- instead, you now simply have to <span style="background-color: #ccddfd;" title="Pin numbers, passwords, usernames, etc.">identify yourself</span> to them, and they know how much money they owe you.

Digital banking is still fundamentally currency-backed.  You can in principal go down and demand dollars instead of the 0's and 1's that are storing your money.  They would give you your dollars, then <span style="background-color: #ccddfd;" title="If too many people do this, banks won't have enough physical cash to fulfill all the request. This is called a run on the bank.">update their ledger</span> to say that you withdrew all your money, and they don't owe you anything anymore.

Digital banking raises some new concerns.  What if someone manages to erase all your 0's and 1's?  What if the bank decides to declare that they don't actually owe you anything?  What if the bank makes a mistake?  The fundamental weakness of digital banking is that without a physical token of value that must be honored (like a grain-receipt), you're placing a whole lot of trust in this institution's record keeping systems.  Of course, one of the strengths is that you're no longer at risk of losing your receipt, or getting it stolen.  After all, 1's and 0's are just a secondary abstraction- we've already abstracted the ACTUAL underlying value of THINGS into currency.  Thieves could always have stolen your dollars <span style="background-color: #ccddfd;" title="Whether or not it's easier to hack digital bank ledgers than to steal physical dollars is another interesting question without a clear answer.">even without</span> digital banking.
<h2>Fundamental question: what happens if we lose faith in currency?</h2>
This is the fundamental question I've been driving at so far: what happens if we lose faith in our modern floating currencies?  Answer: the world breaks.

When people lose faith in a currency, it's called hyper-inflation, and it's devastating to an economy.  You can buy a loaf of bread in the morning for $1, and come back in the evening and the same bread is priced at $5.  This kind of thing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe">actually happens</a>.

In reality, our situation is not quite that precarious.  Remember, the two things maintaining currency value are human psychology and the fact that governments will do just about everything in their power to make sure bad currency swings don't happen.  In the case of hyper-inflation, the currency-issuing authority would aggressively contract the money supply, trying to bring the supply more in line with demand.  The typical response to inflation is to <span style="background-color: #ccddfd;" title="Though even there, not everybody agrees this is the right solution.">raise interest rates</span>, but that doesn't seem to be very effective against hyper-inflation.  This makes intuitive sense- the reason raising interest rates works to curb inflation is because it makes money <span style="background-color: #ccddfd;" title="Borrowing money means you're going to have to pay it back at a higher rate.">more expensive</span>, which causes fewer people to take risks, which slows down the economy.  In hyper-inflation, the problem is not too many people borrowing too much money to make too many investments, the problem is a loss of confidence in the future value of the currency.  Raising interest rates doesn't do anything to change that.

I speculated earlier that governments could temporarily return to the gold standard- if they guarantee that a dollar can be redeemed for a certain amount of gold, then they've pegged the price of the dollar to the exchange rate of gold.  Assuming people still think <span style="background-color: #ccddfd;" title="Which, again, is better if you don't think too hard about it.">gold has value</span>, crisis averted.  Anybody selling their dollar for less than it's worth in gold will be taken advantage of by their enterprising neighbor, who takes their dollars and exchanges them for gold.  But now we've established a race between the solvency of the government and the fear of the populace.  If <em>enough</em> people redeem their dollars for gold, the government won't have enough gold to satiate them all.  They could of course artificially devalue the dollar again, just like they did after WWII, but this would not avoid the devastating economic effect.  It would just make it slightly-less-bad.

But this isn't a problem unique to currency; this is a fundamental problem with human-created institutions.  Ultimately, if 51% of people want anarchy, then anarchy we shall have.
